# QConQuantifier
Description
-------

The QConQuantifier provides researchers with interest in targeted proteomics using quantification qconcatamers (QConcats) 
with an easy-to-use-all-in-one software solution as a console tool.

 
Motiviation
-------

This project was created within the scope of the applied F# Challenge 2019. 
It can be understood as an show case for the use of F# in the field of computational proteomics, 
using mainly .Net technologies and libraries. (e.g. [BioFSharp](https://github.com/CSBiology/BioFSharp), [BioFSharp.Mz](https://github.com/CSBiology/BioFSharp.Mz), [FSharp.Stats](https://github.com/CSBiology/FSharp.Stats), [Deedle](https://github.com/fslaborg/Deedle) and [MzLite](https://github.com/CSBiology/MzLite)).
For detailed information giving insights in technical background, tutorials and  
general information about the QConcat technlology, please see the [documentation](https://zimmerd.github.io/QConQuantifier/).

Setup
-------

1. The QConQuantifier library can be downloaded from <a href="https://github.com/ZimmerD/QConQuantifier">github</a>. 
2. To build the tool please make sure that you have installed:  
	- 2.1 the latest  <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download">.NET Core SDK</a> AND <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/downloadr">.NET Framework Dev Pack</a>.   
	- 2.2 the fake cli via "dotnet tool install fake-cli -g", build by calling "fake build" in the root of the project. For details regarding projects based uppon the project scaffold please visit <a href="https://github.com/fsprojects/ProjectScaffold">ProjectScaffold</a> or <a href="https://github.com/CSBiology/CsbScaffold">CsbScaffold</a>. 
3. Once everything is set up you can download the<a href="https://1drv.ms/u/s!Ak2uNQ51QZNO00VztxLIcEIKTZpi">sample datasets</a> and get started!

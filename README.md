# QConQuantifier
### Description
The QConQuantifier provides researchers with interest in targeted proteomics using quantification qconcatamers (QConcats) 
with an easy-to-use-all-in-one software solution provided as a script and console tool.

 
### Motiviation
This project was created within the scope of the applied F# Challenge 2019. 
It can be understood as an show case for the use of F# in the field of computational proteomics, 
using mainly .Net technologies and libraries. (e.g. [BioFSharp](https://github.com/CSBiology/BioFSharp), [BioFSharp.Mz](https://github.com/CSBiology/BioFSharp.Mz), [FSharp.Stats](https://github.com/CSBiology/FSharp.Stats), [Deedle](https://github.com/fslaborg/Deedle) and [MzLite](https://github.com/CSBiology/MzLite)).
For detailed information giving insights in technical background, tutorials and  
general information about the QConcat technlology, please see the [documentation](https://zimmerd.github.io/QConQuantifier/).
